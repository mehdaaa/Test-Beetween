**Project Setup**
-----------------

To set up the project , follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to the `/back` directory and start the server by running the following command:
```bash
cd /back
npm i 
node index.js
```
2. In a separate terminal, navigate to the `/front` directory and start the client by running the following command:
```bash
cd /front
npm i
npm start
```
This will start the front and back simultaneously, allowing you to use the application locally.
